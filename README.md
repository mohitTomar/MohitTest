Build a simple app to hit the NY Times Most Popular Articles API and show a list of articles

I have used the most viewed section of this API. Note: you need to signup for an API key at: https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started, then replace the ‘apiKey’ value in AppConstant File.

Steps to run the application:-

Download the source to directory x.
Open the terminal.
Execute below command:- cd [path to direcory x]
Execute another command :- pod install
Open .xcworkspace file and run the application.
Object oriented programming approach

• I have used autolayout to get generic UI and used MVVM design pattern to implement the functionality

• Unit tests using XCTest :- just added a test case as example to create or run other test cases

• Some UI tests using XCUITest :- just added a UI test case as example to create or run other UI test cases

• Swift is used to develop this application.
